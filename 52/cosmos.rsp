Episode 1 - "Standing Up in the Milky Way"

Apparently, it is widely accepted that we are living in a simulation. I wonder how space factors into that. Someone simulated a big bang and all of the sudden, life springs up from an explosion. I've never really held any interest in space, but I find the science behind the rockets and engineering things fascinating. It is also insane to think how insignificant we are. I was asked if humans would exist in the some large number of years, and I didn't think so.

Jesus wasn't actually born on Christmas, but because of the winter solstice and other festivals/holidays around this time, Christianity wanted conversions, it would be easier if Jesus was born around the same time. Life is illogical and random, but we seem to always try to order it and make it fit within a little box so we can understand it better. I don't think we can understand everything about space. I don't really like Newton because physics.

I didn't know lead didn't occur naturally on Earth's surface. It is like finding Kryptonite. Science is cool.
